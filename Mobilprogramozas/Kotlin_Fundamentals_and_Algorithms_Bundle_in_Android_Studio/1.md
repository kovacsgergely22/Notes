# Intro - Kotlin Language Basics

* Kotlin - the new programming language for android
* Object oriented like Java but more syntactially flexible
* Big differences include:
  * changes in function and variable declarations and general syntax
  * changes to how we convert between variable types and which conversions are allowed
  * introduction of nullable variables and ways to avoid null pointer exceptions
  * changes in collection type syntax and increased flexibility as well as new range operators
  * the ability to turn many statements into expressions
  * for-in loops instead of conventional for loops
  * default and named function parameters

***Topics we will cover:***
1. Variables
2. Collection types
3. Control flow
3. Functions
4. Classes, objects, and other structs

Keep in mind that these are just language basics; we will not go super in depth into these topics and will save many
of the more advanced topics for sections devoted to advanced language topics in Kotlin in which we will go further in
depth into some of the previous concepts as well as explain many new and more difficult concepts. The goal of these
language basics is to introduce newbies to programming in Kotlin, highlight big differences between Kotlin and Java,
and to provide viewers with enough knowledge about the basics that they can then start developing apps, perform
further independent research into other Kotlin topics, and begin to understand the more advanced language sections
